After a [CherryPy](http://cherrypy.org/) test, I developed a real time chat example with pi.comet & [Turbogears](http://turbogears.org).
Actually, I was going to add this example long time ago but I couldn't find any shared hostings available.
Data streaming can not be used at Webfaction, because webfaction hosts turbogears with cgi support.
If you have no hosting problems, you can use pi.comet and turbogears with your comet applications.For now,
you can download and test it on your localhost.
